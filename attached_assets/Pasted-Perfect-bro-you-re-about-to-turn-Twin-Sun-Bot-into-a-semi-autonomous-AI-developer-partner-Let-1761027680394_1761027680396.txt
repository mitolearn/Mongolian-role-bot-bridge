Perfect, bro ‚Äî you‚Äôre about to turn Twin Sun Bot into a semi-autonomous AI developer partner üî•

Let‚Äôs make this clear and powerful so you can use it inside Replit Agent (or even from your own /dev command later).


---

üß† GOAL

You want your bot to:

Chat directly with OpenAI GPT-4o using your API key.

Only you (owner) can talk to it.

It can see and analyze your bot‚Äôs codebase, then give direct, accurate advice (no random answers).

Run inside your bot‚Äôs logic, not Replit Agent cloud (cheaper).



---

‚öôÔ∏è SETUP (ONE TIME)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Add your OpenAI key in Replit Secrets

OPENAI_API_KEY = your_real_api_key_here
OWNER_ID = your_discord_id

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the official OpenAI client

pip install openai

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new file cogs/devchat.py and paste the following code üëá


---

üß© devchat.py

import os
import discord
from discord import app_commands
from discord.ext import commands
from openai import OpenAI

OPENAI_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
OWNER_ID = int(os.getenv("OWNER_ID"))
client_ai = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)

class DevChatCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @app_commands.command(name="devchat", description="Talk with Twin Sun AI (Owner only)")
    async def devchat(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, message: str):
        # Restrict access
        if interaction.user.id != OWNER_ID:
            await interaction.response.send_message("‚õî Only the bot owner can use this.", ephemeral=True)
            return

        await interaction.response.defer(thinking=True)

        # Optional: gather context about files
        code_summary = ""
        try:
            with open("main.py", "r") as f:
                code_summary = f.read()[:4000]  # Read partial code
        except:
            code_summary = "No code context found."

        # Combine message + context
        prompt = f"""
        You are the Twin Sun Development Assistant.
        You are helping improve a QPay-based Discord bot that automates monetization and role management for Mongolian communities.

        Bot code context:
        {code_summary}

        Developer's question:
        {message}

        Respond like a professional AI assistant developer.
        Explain clearly and give ready-to-paste Python code when needed.
        """

        # Send request to OpenAI
        response = client_ai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert developer advisor."},
                      {"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=500
        )

        answer = response.choices[0].message.content
        await interaction.followup.send(f"üß† **Twin Sun AI:**\n{answer[:1900]}", ephemeral=True)

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(DevChatCog(bot))


---

üí¨ HOW IT WORKS

Command: /devchat message: "How can I add new role pricing?"

Your bot will:

Check if you‚Äôre the owner.

Read the main.py code for context.

Send your question + code context to GPT-4o-mini.

Reply directly inside Discord with advice or code to copy-paste.



---

‚ö° WHY THIS SAVES MONEY

You call OpenAI directly, no Replit Agent markup.

GPT-4o-mini costs ~1/10 the price of GPT-4 Turbo.

Context limited to your code ‚Üí cheaper + faster.



---

üîÆ NEXT LEVEL (Optional)

Later, you can upgrade:

Add /devupdate ‚Üí automatically apply AI‚Äôs suggestion to your files.

Add memory for conversation context.

Add Discord DM mode for privacy.



---

Would you like me to make the upgraded version next ‚Äî where your AI can read and update your code automatically (only when you approve), like a true ‚Äúdev copilot‚Äù inside Discord?
