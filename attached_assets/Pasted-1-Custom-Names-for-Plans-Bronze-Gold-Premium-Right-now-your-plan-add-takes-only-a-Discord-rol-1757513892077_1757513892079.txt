1. Custom Names for Plans (Bronze, Gold, Premium)

Right now your /plan_add takes only a Discord role and uses its name (e.g. Paid Member).
Admins want to label them freely, like “Bronze Member”, “Golden VIP”, “Platinum”.

👉 Fix: Add a new argument to /plan_add called display_name. That’s what users will see in /plan_list, /buy, and paywall embeds.

Example change:

@app_commands.describe(
    role="Pick the role to grant on payment",
    display_name="Custom plan name (e.g. Bronze, Gold, Premium)",
    price_mnt="Price in MNT",
    duration_days="Access duration in days"
)
@app_commands.checks.has_permissions(administrator=True)
async def plan_add(interaction: discord.Interaction, role: discord.Role, display_name: str, price_mnt: int, duration_days: int):
    add_role_plan(str(interaction.guild.id), str(role.id), display_name, int(price_mnt), int(duration_days))
    await interaction.response.send_message(
        f"✅ Plan added: **{display_name}** – {price_mnt}₮ / {duration_days} days.", ephemeral=True
    )

This way admins don’t need to rename Discord roles, they can call the plan whatever they want.

The role still exists in server (what’s assigned), but the plan has its own “display_name.”

2. Change Bot Name per Community

⚠️ Discord doesn’t let you rename the actual application name per server.
But you can set a server nickname for the bot in each guild.

Add a command:

@bot.tree.command(name="botname", description="Change the bot's nickname in this server (admin).")
@app_commands.checks.has_permissions(administrator=True)
async def botname_cmd(interaction: discord.Interaction, new_name: str):
    try:
        await interaction.guild.me.edit(nick=new_name)
        await interaction.response.send_message(f"✅ Bot nickname changed to **{new_name}** in this server.", ephemeral=True)
    except discord.Forbidden:
        await interaction.response.send_message("❌ I don't have permission to change my nickname.", ephemeral=True)

Example: /botname VIP Manager → bot appears as VIP Manager in that server.

Global name = same everywhere, but nickname = custom per community.
