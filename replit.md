## Recent Changes

### October 21, 2025 - Status Command Improvements & Bot Subscription Visibility
- **Fixed "Available to Collect" Math**: Corrected gross calculation to show uncollected amount (not total revenue)
  - Gross now correctly shows amount before 3% fee deduction
  - Fee calculation accurate for available balance
  - Net shows actual collectible amount after fees
- **Bot Subscription Visibility**: Added subscription expiry info to admin commands
  - `/status` command now shows bot subscription plan, expiry date, and days remaining
  - `/bot_info` command displays subscription status at the top
  - Color-coded warnings: 🟢 (>7 days), 🟡 (≤7 days), 🔴 (expired)
  - Proactive admin reminders to renew before expiry
- **User Experience**: Admins can now see when bot subscription ends before it stops working
- **Top Members Display Fix**: `/topmembers` now shows actual Discord nicknames/usernames instead of user IDs
  - Fetches live Discord member data for accurate display names
  - Shows server nicknames (if set) or Discord usernames
  - Fallback to user ID only if member left server

### October 21, 2025 - Soft-Delete Plan System (Data Preservation)
- **Historical Data Preservation**: Implemented soft-delete for role plans to preserve all analytics and payment history
- **Database Schema Update**: Added `deleted_at` column to `role_plans` table with automatic migration
- **Smart Renewal Flow**: When deleted plans expire, users see "See Other Plans" button only (not "Renew Same Plan")
- **User Experience**: `/myplan` command shows deleted plans with ⚠️ indicator and "Plan Removed" warning while keeping expiry info
- **Analytics Integrity**: All analytics commands (`/growth`, `/topmembers`, `/status`) include deleted plans in historical data
- **Admin Benefits**: Admins can now see which deleted plans were most efficient and profitable
- **Technical**: Soft-delete preserves all relationships (payments, memberships) preventing data loss

### October 21, 2025 - AI Developer Assistant Integration
- **New Feature**: Added `/devchat` command for owner-only AI-powered development assistance
- **Direct OpenAI Integration**: Integrated GPT-4o model to provide code analysis and development advice
- **Cost Optimization**: Direct API calls to OpenAI (bypassing Replit Agent) to minimize development costs
- **Full Codebase Access**: AI reads ALL Python files (main, cogs, utils) plus documentation files for comprehensive understanding
- **Replit Agent-Level Capabilities**: Enhanced system prompt enables expert-level development assistance comparable to Replit Agent
- **Security**: Command restricted to bot owner via OWNER_ID environment variable
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Created `cogs/devchat.py` with full codebase scanning functionality
  - Updated OpenAI library to version 2.6.0 for modern API support
  - Added OWNER_ID secret management
  - AI receives complete project context: all .py files, replit.md, requirements.txt, and setup documentation
  - 4000 token output limit for comprehensive responses

## Overview

This Discord bot facilitates community management, integrating payment processing and leader commission tracking. It handles user registration, payment confirmations via QPay, and manages leader balances with a commission-based reward system. The bot is developed in Python using `discord.py` with SQLite for data persistence. Its purpose is to streamline community operations, automate payment handling, and provide valuable insights through AI-powered analytics. The project aims to enable efficient monetization and growth for Discord communities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Interactive Buttons**: Extensive use of Discord buttons for payment, renewal, and navigation.
- **Rich Embeds**: Visually appealing and informative embeds for commands like `/myplan`, `/growth`, `/topmembers`, and `/bot_info`.
- **Color-Coded Status**: Visual cues (e.g., 🟢, 🟡, 🔴) for membership status in `/myplan`.
- **Modals for Input**: Utilizes Discord modals for multi-line text input, such as plan descriptions.
- **Chart Visualization**: Integration with QuickChart.io for generating visual growth and revenue charts.

### Technical Implementations
- **Modular Python**: Codebase structured with separate modules for database operations (`database.py`), bot commands (cogs), and utilities.
- **SQLite Database**: Simple, reliable file-based database with no external dependencies.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Leverages `asyncio` with `discord.py` for non-blocking I/O and efficient handling of concurrent requests.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive null checks and error handling for Discord API interactions, database operations, and external API calls.
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Uses environment variables for sensitive credentials (Discord token, QPay keys) and configuration settings.

### Feature Specifications
- **Payment System**:
    - **QPay Integration**: Direct integration with QPay Mongolia for invoice generation and payment verification.
    - **Dual Purchase System**: Users can buy roles via `/paywall` (admin-posted) or `/buy` (user-initiated ephemeral).
    - **Multi-Role Support**: Users can hold multiple roles simultaneously, each with independent expiry.
    - **Subscription Renewal**: Automated expiry warnings, flexible renewal options (QPay or collected balance), and proper time extension logic.
    - **Universal Payment Backup**: `/verifypayment` command to manually verify payments if automated checks fail.
- **Commission & Payout System**:
    - **Leader Associations**: Tracks user payments linked to specific leaders.
    - **Automated Commissions**: Calculates and updates leader balances based on confirmed payments.
    - **Minimum Payouts**: Enforces a minimum collection amount (100,000₮) before allowing payout requests.
    - **Detailed Payout Confirmations**: Sends DMs to admins and owners with comprehensive transaction details upon payout completion.
- **Analytics & Reporting**:
    - **AI-Powered Weekly Reports**: Automated weekly reports to server admins with comprehensive growth data and GPT-4o powered business recommendations.
    - **Growth Analytics Dashboard**: `/growth` command provides admins with revenue trends, role plan breakdowns, active member count, and AI-driven insights.
    - **Top Members Dashboard**: `/topmembers` command displays top spenders overall and per plan.
- **Community Management**:

    - **Role Automation**: Automatic Discord role assignment/removal based on payment status and expiry.
    - **Bot Information**: `/bot_info` command provides critical warnings, command list, and a detailed guide.
- **Developer Tools**:
    - **AI Developer Assistant**: `/devchat` command (owner-only) provides GPT-4o powered development advice with complete codebase access
